## üß© Permissions and Manifest Settings

The extension uses Manifest V3 and requires minimal permissions to function:

| Permission | Purpose | Justification |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| `activeTab` | Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab | Required to inject the viewport panel into the current page. Limited to the active tab only for security and privacy. Does not access browsing history or other tabs. |
| `host_permissions: <all_urls>` | Allows content scripts to run on all websites | Required to show the viewport panel on any website. Does not collect any data from these sites. |

Manifest settings:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Tailgunner",
  "description": "Displays viewport size and Tailwind CSS breakpoint",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "<all_urls>"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Toggle Tailgunner Panel"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": [
        "<all_urls>"
      ],
      "js": [
        "content.js"
      ],
      "run_at": "document_idle"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Manifest Settings Explanation

- **manifest_version: 3** - Uses the latest, most secure manifest version as required by Chrome
- **background.service_worker** - Uses the modern service worker approach instead of background pages
- **content_scripts** - Run at "document_idle" to ensure the page is fully loaded before injecting the panel
- **action** - Simple browser action with no popup, just toggles the panel on click

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technical Implementation

The extension consists of three main files:

1. **manifest.json**: Configuration file that defines extension metadata, permissions, and behavior.
2. **background.js**: Service worker that handles extension icon clicks and messaging.
3. **content.js**: Content script that creates and manages the viewport panel.

### Architecture & Versioning

**Current Version: 1.0**

- **Message Passing**: Uses Chrome's message passing system to communicate between background and content scripts.
- **Event Handling**: Efficiently manages browser events with debouncing for performance.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Creates and updates the panel using vanilla JavaScript.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and reporting.

### Tailwind Breakpoints

The extension uses standard Tailwind CSS breakpoints:

| Breakpoint | Width (px) |
|------------|------------|
| none       | < 640      |
| sm         | ‚â• 640      |
| md         | ‚â• 768      |
| lg         | ‚â• 1024     |
| xl         | ‚â• 1280     |
| 2xl        | ‚â• 1536     |

## üêû Error Handling and Debugging

The extension includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Validation**: Input validation for all parameters and operations.
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Wrapped around all critical operations.
- **Console Logging**: Descriptive error messages with 'Tailgunner:' prefix for easy identification.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fails safely and cleans up resources when errors occur.

For developers, a debug mode can be enabled by setting `DEBUG = true` in content.js. When enabled, additional console messages will help trace execution flow and state changes during development.
